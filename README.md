# dbcom
Database Commander with oldschool ncurses-like UI. 

I planned features and UI of this app several years ago but each time can't find motivations to start it. 
Hackaton give me such motivation. Well after starting I found what this project requires significantly more time 
than couple of days during the hackaton. But I happy for spent time because work really has started.
I will continue development in my repo http://github.com/grafov/bcom

Happy hacking to all Gophergala participants! :)
